   <h1>Friends of Botanica Park Lake</h1>
   
   <p>In 2019 the water quality of the lake was so bad that there 
   was an outbreak of Avian botulism which resulted in the death 
   of many birds and fish.</p>
   
   <p>New plantings at the lake and less duck feeding has 
   improved the lake quality.</p>
   
   <p>Students at the Mill Park Library Makers Club have been working 
   on a range of technologies to help improve Botanica Park Lake.</p>

   <p>They are currently using a GPS Litter Picker to remove litter 
   and will be doing more community planting days to create more habitat.</p>
